DE12A.java implements Huffman encoding as described in Lecture 3/10/2021.  

DE12B.java is the decoder that requires your couple of lines.  

Try to provide these lines so you can move up and down the Huffman tree with the
variable k and decode DE12test1, a binary file with the format specified in the 
Lecture and submit your code and the decoded text file.
