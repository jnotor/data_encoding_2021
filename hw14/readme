DE15A.java is the JBIG adaptive arithmetic encoder (for fax) and DE15B.java the 
decoder.  Complete a few lines in update() of DE15B so that you can decode 
whatever you encoded with DE15A.  Of course we can only encode PBM files with 
the type P4 and the file hand.bmp is an example.  

Apply your decoder DE15B to DE15test1 and show the decoded PBM file using a 
screenshot along with your code.
