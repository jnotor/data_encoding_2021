DE14A.java performs (5,3)-wavelet transform on a BMP image like LenaRGB.bmp and 
then does shrinkage of the high-frequency coefficients, followed by C1 encoding 
using codewords in fib512.txt.  (The resulting file still has the BMP header but 
will not be displayed by paint because the data part has been compressed.) 

DE14B.java is to be its inverse. Complete DE14B by completing defib() as part of 
decode(), the inverse of DE14A.encode(), and inverseColumnTransform() by exchanging
i and j in inverseRowTransform().  (You may be able to test these two inverses 
individually if you can.) 

Submit your code and its run on DE14test1 as a decoded BMP file.
