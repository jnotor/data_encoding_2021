DE17A.java implements the LZW encoder and outputs a list of the codewords 
(indices in the dictionary for the longest matches).

DE17B.java is the decoder and you need to complete the updating of the dictionary.

Make sure that your decoder is the inverse of DE17A and decode DE17test1.txt.

Submit your code and the decoded DE17test1.txt.

Table Building: Decoder
•Encoded data is a sequence of codewords/table-indexes.

•For each codeword, build a new entry and place the codeword/index as its prefix
component.

•The second component is the first byte of the phrase represented by the next
codewordin the encoded data.

•Loop: read next codeword, output the corresponding phrase in the dictionary 
using the codeword as the index, fill the second component of the last phrase 
with the first byte of the phrase just output, fill the first component of the 
next entry with the codeword
