Write a function or add lines to DE20A.java to be able to get from sample-5s.mp4:

Time scale and duration from each of mvhd, tkhd, mdhd, and smhd.

Number of entries (usually starting at 3 * 4 bytes in an atom) in each of stsd, 
stts, stss, stsc, stsz, and stco.

After the entry number, there is often a table starting with the first entry with
atoms starting with size and type.

What are the size and type of the first entry in stsd for both movie and sound? 
NOTE: (type is not an integer, but a String)

What are the offset of the first chunk for movie and that for sound?
